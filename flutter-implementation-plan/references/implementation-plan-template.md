# Implementation Plan Template

## Global Constraints

- Flutter app, mobile first.
- Follow the approved product, UI, and technical specs.
- Use the generated project-local `flutter-dev` skill for implementation tasks.
- Do not add features outside MVP scope.
- UI tasks require screenshot or golden evidence.
- UI page tasks require a validated `docs/design/pages/<page-name>/layout-spec.yaml`, its validator command/result, relation invariants, and parameterized test matrix; screenshots/goldens do not replace these implementation inputs.
- UI page tasks require the risk-selected Code Sketch evidence. Full uses a complete production skeleton, screenshots, and independent review; Lightweight uses the skeleton and relationship tests with screenshots by risk; Reuse records the approved pattern and delta, with full review only when structural facts change.
- Module and page tasks must follow `docs/plans/module-map.md` for business-flow levels, module dependencies, cross-module contracts, and page interaction order. Finish and verify each level before starting the next. Default to one writer and sequential execution; only read-only work may parallelize unless the user explicitly authorizes parallel writing/worktrees.
- Treat the cross-module task list as provisional until the current module becomes eligible. Audit existing decisions, run grilling only for material unresolved choices, then refine functions, states, acceptance paths, and task briefs.
- Follow the global platform scope in `docs/architecture/verification-platforms.md`. Do not treat unlisted platforms as verified.
- Run representative startup/routing/plugin smoke after shared foundations, primary-target runtime smoke after critical business flows, and the complete platform matrix at final integration/release. Task-level evidence proves only its named coverage; never auto-start physical-device acceptance.
- Every task requires executed F0 verification output before F1 triage or F2 specialist review.
