# Mockup Brief Template

Fill this transiently during module implementation before generating page images or dispatching a visual agent. Write it only after the user confirms a page freeze and the exact selected image is persisted under `.codex-workflow/visuals/pages/<page-name>/`.

## Freeze Record

- Frozen image path:
- Source candidate ID:
- SHA-256:
- Decoded dimensions: `780 x 1688 px`
- User confirmation time:

## Module and Page

- Confirmed module scope:
- Module Effect-Image Interrogation Gate:
- Name:
- Route or flow:
- User goal:
- Business goal:
- First-value contribution:
- Safe-to-try condition:
- UX/UI decision to confirm:
- Source wireframe level and semantic contract:
- High-fidelity recomposition freedom: exact geometry, containers, whitespace, component silhouettes, image ratios/crops, text-image orientation, and decoration placement
- Primary action:
- Secondary actions:

## Product Context

- Target user:
- Core promise:
- Commercial context:
- Trust requirements:
- Risk, permission, payment, privacy, or recovery disclosure:

## Device Targets

- Primary device:
- Secondary device:
- Orientation:
- Exact output size: `780 x 1688 px`
- Safe area or platform constraints:

## Required States

| State | Generate mockup? | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Success | Yes / No | |
| Loading | Yes / No | |
| Empty | Yes / No | |
| Error | Yes / No | |
| Disabled | Yes / No | |
| Permission | Yes / No | |
| Paywall | Yes / No | |

## Visual Direction

- Design system baseline:
- Visual expression preset ID and axes:
- Page-type budget dial: full / moderate / dial-down
- Restatable signature required for this mockup: Yes / No — description or N/A reason:
- Brand traits:
- Decoration purpose and limits:
- Avoid:
- References:
- Density:
- Motion impression:

## Content Requirements

- Realistic user data:
- Required copy:
- Icons or imagery:
- Legal or price text:

## Image Prompt Contract

This brief is planning evidence, not the text sent to the image model. Build the final prompt with [image-prompt-principles.md](image-prompt-principles.md) and include only:

- the screen outcome and primary task;
- essential hierarchy and required content;
- the approved visual signature and a few concrete cues;
- material scope, state, trust, accessibility, or compositing constraints;
- viewpoint, frame rule, and required dimensions;
- only the most likely material failure modes.

Do not include source paths, rationale, requirement mappings, exhaustive component/token specifications, repeated negatives, or decorative adjective stacks. Leave secondary composition and detail open unless frozen evidence makes them non-negotiable.
