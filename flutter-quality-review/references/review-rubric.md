# Flutter Commercial Review Rubric

## Spec Compliance

- MVP scope implemented and no extra scope added.
- Acceptance criteria are met.
- Required states and flows exist.
- Product assumptions are not silently changed.
- Task follows `docs/plans/module-map.md` for business-flow level, module dependency order, cross-module contracts, and page interaction order.
- No task started before all required tasks, acceptance paths, and cross-module contracts of its preceding business-flow level passed or were explicitly accepted.
- Cross-module contracts are implemented before dependent UI or service work consumes them.
- Module acceptance path and integration smoke path are preserved or updated when module behavior changes.
- Module acceptance result and integration smoke result are reported when module boundaries, routes, cross-module contracts, or user flows change.
- `docs/architecture/verification-platforms.md` records representative foundation smoke, primary-target critical-flow smoke, and the final matrix. Early evidence proves only its named scope; unlisted or unrun platforms are not claimed as verified.

## Flutter Code Quality

- Project-local `flutter-dev` rules are present, read, and followed.
- State ownership is clear.
- Widgets are focused and not oversized.
- Shared UI primitives are reused.
- Existing plugins and primitives are preferred before new dependencies.
- Only dependency profiles actually enabled by the technical design are required, and each adopted package has an explicit capability reason.
- Annotation-based generation and `build_runner` are checked only when the adopted data/API or complex-domain profile uses them.
- State changes are minimal and rebuild scope is controlled.
- Async work handles loading, error, retry, and cancellation where relevant.
- Platform permissions are requested with clear user value.
- No hardcoded secrets or production keys.

## UX/UI

- UI evidence exists for screen changes.
- Independent visual-QA findings for user-facing flows are resolved or explicitly accepted.
- Page implementation order does not skip required prior interactions, states, or transitions from the module map.
- Page-level high-fidelity target was generated only after a validated sketch spec, production Code Sketch/tests, and independent Code Sketch Review.
- The user-frozen target was checked back against the reviewed semantic contract; scope, states, navigation, scrolling, breakpoints, accessibility or ownership changes returned to sketch review.
- Fidelity implementation refactors the same production skeleton and does not overlay the old sketch with absolute positioning to fake pixels.
- Implemented UI respects the selected mockup and page decision constraints when present.
- A page asset manifest exists when approved mockups include required visual assets.
- Asset source, reuse decision, generation prompt constraints, background handling, license status, output/Flutter path, loading fallback and error fallback are recorded in the manifest.
- New bitmap assets use approved generation/reuse evidence and never derive from representative runtime data.
- Every icon, image, illustration, logo, texture, and bitmap unit has 100%-match evidence and a separate-asset review verdict. An unmatched resource completed dedicated bitmap generation and asset fidelity review; near-match system icons, Flutter components, and existing assets are rejected.
- Transparent or composited assets have clean alpha edges, preserved shadows/glows, and no unintended background halos.
- Transparent-background post-processing records matte removal, alpha cleanup, edge decontamination, padding, and target-background QA when applicable.
- New generated assets reference global visual-direction and page-design-decision constraints and explain why existing assets were not reused.
- Icon, image, illustration, logo, texture, and bitmap fidelity matches the approved mockup 100%; only documented rasterization or scaling tolerance is allowed.
- Implemented UI respects the reviewed semantic contract and Code Sketch for scope, structure, states, interactions, scrolling, breakpoints and ownership.
- Critical elements have a complete target↔Flutter parity contract with stable element/reference keys, typed dual-axis relations, recomputable geometry/delta, actual Widget measurement and same-viewport screenshot evidence. Validator or “No layout problems” cannot establish actual parity.
- Critical axes are within 1 logical px; text, Logo and irregular outlines distinguish container center from visible-content optical center. Optical offsets without cited evidence and unresolved visual facts block approval.
- Flutter handoff preserves semantic references and dual-axis relations. Frozen-view `x/y` is auxiliary; a `Positioned` exception names its semantic boundary, viewport scope, and responsive fallback.
- Low-fidelity screenshots constrain function and hierarchy only; their Goldens expire or are replaced after fidelity work starts.
- A page-level layout/adaptation contract records target ranges, structural breakpoint triggers, max width, columns/gutters, relative anchors, overflow/localization behavior, scroll ownership, docking, and system/keyboard avoidance; low fidelity and a frozen screenshot do not substitute for it.
- Text line breaking satisfies the authoritative [Adaptive Layout Implementation](../../adaptive-layout-implementation/SKILL.md) contract: body, heading/critical copy, control labels, atomic text, dynamic containers, fallback order, and longest-copy plus large-text evidence are all present; fixed-height clipping, display-string line-break hacks, `FittedBox`, and font shrinking block approval.
- Layout works on the contract's target viewports and both sides of each applicable structural breakpoint; evidence verifies structural change rather than proportional scaling.
- Fixed, pinned, and floating elements document scroll direction, occlusion padding, hit target, SafeArea/gesture inset, keyboard behavior, and narrow-height fallback; no content or focused field is covered.
- SafeArea, system bars, keyboard `viewInsets`, fold/hinge display features, and split-screen constraints are handled at the right boundary and are represented in evidence when in scope.
- Each scroll axis has a clear owner; nested scrolling is intentional, documented, and does not trap gestures or accessibility focus.
- When the UI-token profile adopts ScreenUtil, it is limited to root initialization and shared sizing tokens. Columns, navigation, max width, scrolling, and structural decisions still come from constraints/`LayoutBuilder`/`MediaQuery`.
- Empty, loading, error, success, disabled, and permission-denied states are covered where relevant.
- CTA hierarchy is clear.
- The first-value path is understandable, and the user sees applicable privacy, payment, permission, or recovery conditions before a high-friction or irreversible step.
- Text is readable, semantically wrapped, and not clipped.
- Accessibility basics are respected.

## Visual Aesthetics And Premium Feel

- Compare the implementation screenshot with the approved mockup and page-design-decision constraints before judging aesthetics.
- Verify hierarchy, alignment, spacing rhythm, typography, color and contrast, component consistency, and asset quality as one visual system.
- Verify that decoration, borders, shadows, corner radii, and accent colors are purposeful and match the active expression preset and page-type budget; flag visual noise, generic treatment, competing focal points, and missing signature on full-budget or wow-required pages. Do not require austerity when the preset calls for higher signature strength.
- Verify that the screen gives visual priority to the primary user task and uses content imagery or assets that fit the product and target audience.
- Verify that the visual system supports the documented product character and that polish does not conceal unclear value, unnecessary friction, or unresolved trust concerns.
- Record an explicit verdict: `approved`, `approved with Minor findings`, or `not approved`. A Critical or Important aesthetic finding results in `not approved` until resolved or explicitly accepted.

## Commercial Readiness

- Account lifecycle is handled when accounts exist.
- Privacy and data deletion paths are not broken.
- Payments handle failure and restoration when monetized.
- Analytics and crash reporting are present or explicitly out of scope.

## API And Service (Conditional)

- Contract source, version policy, request/response/error schema, and client compatibility are explicit.
- Authentication, authorization, permissions and sensitive-data boundaries are tested.
- Retry, timeout, rate-limit and idempotency behavior prevents unsafe duplicate operations.
- Schema/data migration has a rehearsed rollback; destructive changes have backup and recovery evidence.
- In-scope server implementation has unit/integration/contract tests plus deployment, monitoring, alert and restore evidence.
- When server implementation is out of scope, the review is limited to documented external owner, dependency assumptions, client boundary and escalation path.

## Testing

- `fvm flutter analyze` output is reported.
- Relevant unit/widget tests are reported.
- Golden or screenshot evidence exists for UI work.
- Integration tests are run when a user path is changed and tests exist.
- Shared-foundation review includes representative startup/routing/plugin smoke; critical-flow review includes primary-target runtime smoke. Neither may claim full platform verification. Final-integration/release review requires every in-scope platform's matching command and runtime evidence. Physical-device acceptance requires explicit user authorization.
